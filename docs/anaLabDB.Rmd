  anaLabDB is planned to be a simple SQLite3 database for analysts to
  manage specimens and projects.  This is a work-in-progress at a very
  early stage. This version describes the `table-names` branch.

# Do this first

Using this package requires installation of SQLite3 and Python.
I highly recommend SQLiteStudio 3.1.1. I like the Anaconda python
distribution. I prefer the lightweight minconda installer.

The first python scripts use an environment variable, `ANA_DB_DIR`.
This is the root directory for databases. I have this set to 
`D:/Data/db` on my development system. Note Windows will accept
forward slashes for path spacers. Perhaps Bill Gates should have
studied a bit more. Why would anyone use a backslash for a spacer
when that is the escape character in many languages????

I made some test .csv files for generating the database from backup
.csv files. These are in the `./test-data/csv` directory of the git
repository. Copy them into the production or test instance directories
mentioned in the script.


# Current status

Currently there are two scripts working. The
`create-anaLabDB-from-csv.py` script will run from the `./tools/py`
folder of the git repository. The `fix-anaLabDB-after-csv-import.sql`
script in the `./tools/sql` folder of the repository needs to be copied
to the folder with the `anaLabDB.db` file and run from the command line
from sqlite3.

I have a basic Tk dialog that works. Currently, One needs to enter all
the values. I can envision drop-down menus for project number, job number,
the client and the client ID.  There is a prototype of such a menu
[here](https://pythonspot.com/en/tk-dropdown-example/).

My biggest concern is that it takes a lot of code to do this and I'm
not sure of the best way to break it into bite-size, understandable
code. What I have now is better than where I started, but is hard for
me to troubleshoot...

# The `table-names` branch

I am working with a branch: `table-names` where I tried to clean up 
the names of the database a bit. I also moved the `ini` dir into the 
`ANA_DB_DIR` path tree...

The schema from **SQLiteStudio (3.3.1)** now looks like this:

![Note the `scientists` table was renamed to `people`](./png/people-table.png)

![The `people` table schema ](./png/people-table-schema.png)

![The `projects` table was simplified](./png/projects-table.png)

![The `projects` table schema](./png/projects-table-schema.png)

![The `samples` table was simplified where it made sense](./png/sample-table.png)
