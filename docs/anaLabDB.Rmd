  anaLabDB is planned to be a simple SQLite3 database for analysts to
  manage specimens and projects.  This is a work-in-progress at a very
  early stage.

# Do this first

Using this package requires installation of SQLite3 and Python.
I highly recomment SQLiteStudio 3.1.1. I like the Anaconda python
distrbution. I prefere the lightweight minconda installer.

The first python scripts use an environment variable, `ANA_DB_DIR`.
This is the root directory for databases. I have this set to 
`D:/Data/db` on my development system. Note Windows will accept
forward slashes for path spacers. Perhaps Bill Gates should have
studied a bit more. Why would anyone use a backslash for a spacer
when that is the escape character in many languages????

I made some test .csv files for generating the database from backup
.csv files. These are in the `./test-data/csv` directory of the git
repository. Copy them into the production or test instance directories
mentioned in the script.


# Current status

Currently there are two scripts working. The
`create-anaLabDB-from-csv.py` script will run from the `./tools/py`
folder of the git repository. The `fix-anaLabDB-after-csv-import.sql`
script in the `./tools/sql` folder of the repository needs to be copied
to the folder with the `anaLabDB.db` file and run from the command line
from sqlite3.
